Controls, frameworks, and compliance

The confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. 

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. So they are used alongside frameworks to ensure that security goals and processes are implemented correctly and that organizations meet regulatory compliance requirements.

Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. They have four core components:

    1. Identifying and documenting security goals 
    2. Setting guidelines to achieve security goals 
    3. Implementing strong security processes
    4. Monitoring and communicating results

Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations.

Specific controls, frameworks, and compliance
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S.-based agency that develops multiple voluntary compliance frameworks that organizations worldwide can use to help manage risk. 
The more aligned an organization is with compliance, the lower the risk.

Examples of frameworks include the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF).

Ethical concepts that guide cybersecurity decisions

United States standpoint on counterattacks 
In the U.S., deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, among others. 
You can only defend. 
The act of counterattacking in the U.S. is perceived as an act of vigilantism. 
A vigilante is a person who is not a member of law enforcement who decides to stop a crime on their own.
And because threat actors are criminals, counterattacks can lead to further escalation of the attack, which can cause even more damage and harm. 
Lastly, if the threat actor in question is a state-sponsored hacktivist, a counterattack can lead to serious international implications. 
A hacktivist is a person who uses hacking to achieve a political goal. 
The political goal may be to promote social change or civil disobedience. 

For these reasons, the only individuals in the U.S. who are allowed to counterattack are approved employees of the federal government or military personnel. 

International standpoint on counterattacks
The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if: 

    1. The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.
    2. The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
    3. The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
    4. The counterattack effects can be reversed.

Organizations typically do not counterattack because the above scenarios and parameters are hard to measure.
There is a lot of uncertainty dictating what is and is not lawful, and at times negative outcomes are very difficult to control.
Counterattack actions generally lead to a worse outcome, especially when you are not an experienced professional in the field. 

To learn more about specific scenarios and ethical concerns from an international perspective, review updates provided in the Tallinn Manual online.
